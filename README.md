## Project Structure

The project follows a **layered architecture** with three main components:

- **Model**: Contains the data (student details).
- **View**: Handles the display of the data to the user.
- **Controller**: Manages the interaction between the model and the view.

The project is organized into the following packages:

StudentMVC (Project) │ ├── src │ ├── model │ │ └── StudentModel.java │ ├── view │ │ └── StudentView.java │ ├── controller │ │ └── StudentController.java │ └── Main.java

- **Model**: Contains the `StudentModel` class which manages student data.
- **View**: Contains the `StudentView` class to display student details.
- **Controller**: Contains the `StudentController` class that acts as the intermediary between the model and the view.
- **Main**: The entry point of the application where the controller is used to add and display students.

1. StudentModel.java (Model)
This class manages the list of students and their data. It also contains an inner class Student that represents a student entity.

2. StudentView.java (View)
This class is responsible for displaying the student details. It has a method that prints the information of all students.

3. StudentController.java (Controller)
This class handles the interaction between the model and the view. It adds students to the model and calls the view to display the data.
