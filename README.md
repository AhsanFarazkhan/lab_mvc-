# Student Management System - MVC Architecture

## Overview

The **Student Management System** is a simple Java application built using the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern. This system manages student data, including their **ID**, **Name**, **Age**, **GPA**, and **Address**. It showcases how to organize a Java project into a modular structure by separating the logic into three distinct layers:

- **Model**: Manages the data (student information).
- **View**: Displays the data to the user.
- **Controller**: Coordinates the interaction between the model and the view.

This project is designed to be simple and easy to extend for learning purposes.

## Features

- **Model Layer**: A `StudentModel` class that holds student data (ID, Name, Age, GPA, Address).
- **View Layer**: A `StudentView` class that is responsible for displaying student details.
- **Controller Layer**: A `StudentController` class that acts as an intermediary between the `Model` and the `View`.
- **Main Application**: A simple application entry point where students are added and their details are displayed.

## Project Structure

This project follows the **MVC architecture**, and the folder structure is organized as follows:

StudentMVC (Root Project) │ ├── src │ ├── model │ │ └── StudentModel.java # Contains the data and logic for student management. │ ├── view │ │ └── StudentView.java # Displays the student details. │ ├── controller │ │ └── StudentController.java # Controls the flow between Model and View. │ └── Main.java # Entry point of the application.

### Description of Folders/Files:

- **model**: Contains classes related to data management and business logic. For example, `StudentModel.java` holds the student data.
  
- **view**: Contains classes for displaying the output to the user. In this project, `StudentView.java` is used to print the student details in the console.

- **controller**: The `StudentController.java` class contains logic to interact with both the model and view. It fetches data from the model and passes it to the view for display.

- **Main.java**: The entry point of the application, where the execution starts. This file creates instances of the model, view, and controller, and manages their interaction.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: The project is written in Java and requires JDK 8 or higher.
   - [Download the latest JDK here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html).
  
2. **NetBeans IDE**: You can use any IDE that supports Java, but this guide assumes the use of **NetBeans IDE** for simplicity.
   - [Download NetBeans IDE](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html).

3. **Git** (optional): For version control and easy cloning of the repository.
   - [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Cloning the Repository

If you want to clone this repository to your local machine:

1. **Clone via Git**:
   - Open your terminal/command prompt.
   - Run the following command:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/StudentMVC.git
Alternatively, you can download the ZIP of the repository from GitHub.
Importing the Project in NetBeans
Open NetBeans IDE.
Select File > Open Project from the menu.
Navigate to the folder where you saved or cloned the project.
Select the StudentMVC folder and click Open.
Building and Running the Project
In NetBeans, right-click on the Main.java file located in the src folder.
Select Run File from the context menu.
This will run the Main class, which will execute the program, add student data, and display the student details in the console.

Requirements
Java 8 or higher.
NetBeans IDE (or any Java IDE of your choice).
Usage
The program adds three students with sample data and displays their information in the console. Below is the list of student attributes that will be displayed:

Student ID
Name
Age
GPA
Address
Example Output
After running the application, you will see the following output:

Files Overview
1. StudentModel.java (Model)
Contains the Student class to represent student data.
Holds the list of students.
Provides methods to add and retrieve student data.
2. StudentView.java (View)
Responsible for displaying student details.
Has a method displayStudentDetails(List<Student>) to print the information of all students.
3. StudentController.java (Controller)
Connects the Model and View layers.
Adds students to the model and calls the view to display them.
4. Main.java (Main Application)
The entry point of the application.
Creates the instances of the StudentModel, StudentView, and StudentController classes.
Adds sample students and displays their information.
